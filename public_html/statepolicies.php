their own complaint or upon the complaint of any board, officer,
person, corporation, or association or by any person acting for the
interests of itself, its members, or the general public.<br/>
   (c) It does not constitute a violation of this chapter for a
business, agency, or person solely to provide access or connection to

agency, or person has no control, including related capabilities that
are incidental to providing access or connection. This subdivision

develop policies to prohibit the unauthorized recording,
dissemination, and publication of academic presentations for
commercial purposes. Nothing in this chapter is intended to change
existing law as it pertains to the ownership of academic
presentations.<br/>
   (b) The Regents of the University of California and the governing
boards of private postsecondary institutions are requested to, the
Trustees of the California State University shall, and the governing
board of each community college district may, adopt or provide for
